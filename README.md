# How to compile

This rom uses [create-nes-game](https://cppchriscpp.github.io/create-nes-game/) to build. Download a copy
of that to start.

## First time setup

1. Download [create-nes-game](https://cppchriscpp.github.io/create-nes-game/), if you haven't already.
2. (Optional) Run `./create-nes-game install` to install the tool globally
3. Run `create-nes-game download-dependencies` to download dependencies of this game into this folder
4. Proceed to the next section to build the rom.

## Building the game

To build the rom, run `create-nes-game build` in the same directory as this readme file. 

You can run the game using the selected emulator (if available on your operating system) using the 
`create-nes-game run` command. Alternatively, the rom is available in the `rom/` folder.

## Running unit tests

This rom includes unit tests that can be used to verify that the game works. Run them using the 
`create-nes-game test` command. 

The tests are located in the `test/` folder.

└─ temp/                    - Temporary storage for the compiler. Usually safe to ignore
└─ test/                    - Test files for the game, written in javascript. Uses nes-test
└─ tools/                   - Compile and emulation tools required by the game, downloaded by nes-test

## Music

Music is created using [Famitracker 0.4.6](http://famitracker.com/). Once you have music you like, you'll need to
export it for use with this engine. Follow these steps to do so: 

1. In the `File` menu, select `Export Text`
2. Save the generated file into the `sound/` folder as `music.txt`

Next time you run `create-nes-game build` your new music will be added to the game.
